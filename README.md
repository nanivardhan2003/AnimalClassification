# Four Animal Classification Project

## Overview

This project is an animal classification model that identifies the type of animal from an input image. The model is capable of classifying images of four specific animals: **bears, crows, elephants,** and **rats**. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately predict the name of the animal based on its image.

## Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: The model can classify images into four categories: bears, crows, elephants, and rats.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with simple input and output formats.

Ensure our dataset is organized into the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── bears/
├── crows/
├── elephants/
└── rats/
```

## Conclusion

The Animal Classification Project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in accurately classifying animal images into four categories: bears, crows, elephants, and rats. By using a structured dataset and a robust CNN model, this project provides a practical example of multi-class image classification. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing easy integration and use for educational purposes, research, or practical deployments in wildlife monitoring and other relevant fields. Future improvements could expand the number of animal categories, enhance model accuracy, and optimize the model's performance for real-world applications. This project sets a foundation for further exploration in the field of image-based animal classification.
